			<p class="regular"> 
				Kim Seong-geun (Jung Jae-young) is deep in debt and his life seems completely hopeless. He jumps off a bridge into the Han River and washes up on the shore of Bamseom, which lies directly below the bridge. After searching the island he finds it is filled mostly with vegetation and surrounded by the city but too far to shout and he can't swim. He finds a duck-shaped boat and begins to like living on the island, free of his debt and worries of city life, though it is not easy.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3 class="bold"> Posters </h3>
			<p class="regular"> The Korean version of the poster is known as one of the most unsuccessful movie posters in Korea. It failed to capture the actual mood of the movie, and rather made the movie's genre a comedy. The Japanese poster contains the setting of the movie, but the actor looks too comfortable on the bush, where he actually is not in the movie. The Italian and US posters are doing a better job at capturing the man's struggle to survive. The actor appears naked in both of the posters, and in action to survive on the island. </p>
