		<p class="regular"> 
			Oh Mal-soon, a 74-year-old widow, lives with her son and his family. Foul-mouthed, stubborn, controlling and shameless, she has a difficult relationship with her depressed daughter-in-law Ae-ja, but is very proud of her son Hyun-chul, who became a university professor of gerontology, and whom she raised by herself against all odds. One day, Ae-ja gets hospitalized after suddenly collapsing. Her doctors strongly advise her to live apart from Mal-soon. On the day she is told by her son that she is being sent to a nursing home, the dismayed Mal-soon wanders the streets and comes across a mysterious photo studio that claims it captures the moments of one's youth. She takes what she believes will be her last self-portrait for her not-so-far-off funeral, but when she comes out of the studio, Mal-soon is dumbfounded by her own reflection in the mirror: she's now a fresh, young 20-year-old woman.

		<h3 class="bold"> Posters </h3>
		<p class="regular"> The Korean version of the poster is using an image of a grandma and a young girl holding hands together. They are wearing the same outfit and have same hairstyle to hint about the plot. The text on the center reads, "What year do you want to go back?" The Japanese version of the poster focuses on the younger girl and have read background. On the top, there is an image of grandma who appears to be reminiscing in front of the framed photos. One of the photos have the image of the young girl who is dressed the same with the girl in the poster. The Korean version is more successful at making the contrast more obvious to the audience, while Japanese poster might be too subtle to hint the plot. </p>
