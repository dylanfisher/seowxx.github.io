		<p class="regular"> 
			Upon his release from prison, Hong Jong-du (Sol Kyung-gu) goes looking for his relatives in Seoul. His brothers have moved and neither they and nor their mother are aware Jong-du is back on the streets after serving a three-year prison term for a hit-and-run accident. He quickly discovers that during his absence his family has moved without telling him. Oblivious to society's rules, Jong-du again ends up in police custody for non-payment of a restaurant bill. He is bailed out by his younger brother Jong-sae (Ryoo Seung-wan) and reunited with his estranged family who reluctantly take him back in. Slightly mentally disabled and an incurable social misfit, Jong-du is hired as a delivery boy for a neighborhood Chinese restaurant on the recommendation of his older brother Jong-il (Ahn Nae-sang).

		<h3 class="bold"> Posters </h3>
		<p class="regular"> The Korean version of the poster has an image of a couple kissing. There is a woman in a foreign traditional costume, a baby elephant, and a child around the couple that makes viewers curious of the situation. The vertical text on the center of the poster reads, "I want to get up and sing to you. I want to run and kiss you. I want to jump and love you." The typography used for the title looks like a ink run, adding sentimental value to it. The Japanese version is more simple with the title on the top, and an image of couple sitting next to each other looking directly at the camera. It is maybe too simple to intrigue the audience. The US version of the poster has an image of the couple kissing on a utopian land. It is hard to see why the specific typography is used for the title, because it reminds me of some animated movie. Overall, the Korean poster is the best one that both portrays the plot of the movie, and intrigues the audience.  </p>
