			Upon his release from prison, Hong Jong-du (Sol Kyung-gu) goes looking for his relatives in Seoul. His brothers have moved and neither they and nor their mother are aware Jong-du is back on the streets after serving a three-year prison term for a hit-and-run accident. He quickly discovers that during his absence his family has moved without telling him. Oblivious to society's rules, Jong-du again ends up in police custody for non-payment of a restaurant bill. He is bailed out by his younger brother Jong-sae (Ryoo Seung-wan) and reunited with his estranged family who reluctantly take him back in. Slightly mentally disabled and an incurable social misfit, Jong-du is hired as a delivery boy for a neighborhood Chinese restaurant on the recommendation of his older brother Jong-il (Ahn Nae-sang).
